## FoodScan ##
Automate grocery shopping


About
--------

FoodScan allows you to use a barcode scanner to put items into a wunderlist grocery shopping list.
After that the script syncs the list items with the shopping cart.
The list items get enhanced with information from the grocery shop.
If the grocery shop provides multiple results these results can be selected from sub-tasks.
